			<p> As a child, I read books–fantasy books and fairy tales; and these books were my portal to fantasy. I would spend hours a day with my face buried in a book, and if it wasn’t there, it was clouded with daydreams of worlds I'd made up in my head. These stories made me realize that with just the right amount of fantasy, you could imagine, create, and understand almost anything. This is what fantasy and fiction do. </p>
			<p> Fantasy is the key to being imaginative. It transports us to another world, to another place where possibilities stretch farther than infinity. Fiction teaches us how to dream–how to dream for a better world, a better life. It is only through fantasy and imagination that we can invent, innovate, and create change. </p>
			<p> If we look back, we realize that fantasy has always been deeply ingrained in the human experience. Whenever our earliest civilizations wanted to teach, understand, to explore, they didn't use what was there. They imagined. They used the unseen and the invisible to fill the mysterious shadows of their lives. They did not begin their stories with today in our time, but with once upon a time, creating a space of time and possibility. Joseph Campbell once wrote that “all cultures have grown out of myths.” what these myths have given us has been inspirations for aspirations. Inspiration for aspiration. </p>
			<p> Myths and fantasies, these were the first stories that we told ourselves. The ones that inspired us to aspire for something bigger–to create, to grow, to seek something to fill our everlasting curiosity in an unknown world. Fantasy is, in its broadest sense, anything that asks the most important question that human beings can ask: “What if?” What if these phenomena could be explained? What if things aren't in our control? what if there's something bigger out of there? These questions are what gave birth to our ideas. From politics to technology and sciences, fantasy and fiction have encouraged us to further our imaginations and allowed society to further evolve </p>
			<p> Fiction is also our first guide to what is not conventional at home. From emotions to relations to social skills. Growing up with fiction allowed us to understand the gearheads of the world through their experiences. Fiction allows us to imagine what it's like to be doing, feeling, being something else and experiencing different scenarios. These things help us gain a broader sense of critical thinking and empathy as, from a young age, we've learned so many people skills through simple words on pages bound by glue. Researchers in psychology, neuroscience, child development, and biology have continuously been gaining quantifiable scientific evidence that stories have a unique ability to change a person’s point of view. </p>
			<p> Every piece of fiction has its learning and own morals depicted, from the deeply woven themes in the classics to the simpler lessons in children's books.. We should let Katniss Everdeen teach us a lesson about why individuals should not put themselves before the group. We should face the monsters that are our fatal flaws with Percy Jackson, and venture with Agatha and Sophie to discover our own understanding of good and evil. We should learn how to work smart with the three little pigs, and allow Gilgamesh to show how to be content with what we have with </p>
			<p> All of this boils down to one thing: reading – the skill of comprehending the meaning of written matter, a skill whose importance we might question especially in a world where entertainment and faster alternatives to consume information are right in our hands. (gesture to phone) Yet it stays true that your brain needs to work out as much as your body. And reading, especially reading fiction, seems to be one of the best workouts you can get. Not only is it good for you, but also food for society as a whole. While these wonders of modern technology have their place, we, the young generation, have to hold on to reading. It holds the essence of our past and the key to our future, with only access during the present. It is the key to our kingdom. </p>
			<p> Amidst all the magic and make-believe, fiction reveals a lot of truth about humans. How we think, how we evolve, how we invent, how we tackle problems and conquer enemies. There are new stories to venture into every day, new tales that promise to influence, create and spark change–stories that you might even write yourself. So I guess the final question is this: What story will you bring to life?</p>
