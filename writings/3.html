			<p> I hate the number three. Whenever something comes in threes, they really mean they come in two, plus one. This rule applies to almost anything—car rides would always have two in the front and one in the back, roller coaster seats would always come in pairs, and even walking on the sidewalk means two people walking together while one is left following behind them. 3 = 2, + 1. But somehow, I believed we would work—an exception to the universal rule. </p>
			<p> We were the best of friends; we knew each other for about 3 years and had a friendship for the same time. We slept over at each other’s houses, and our parents had a group chat because of the amount of plans we made. We knew each other like the back of our hands: from our favorite colors to our deepest regrets and we talked to each other about everything. Or at least I thought so, because I feel like they’ve known me more than I’ve known them—like I’ve laid myself bare and cold for them, but they’re fully clothed in winter clothing. With them, I felt naked and blind. </p>
			<p> It was a dreadful feeling to know that something was falling apart. What I thought was an unbreakable trio was really two best friends plus me. What I thought was a three-person deal was really a combo plus one. There wasn’t an exact moment where I realized what we had was less of an ‘us’ and more of a ‘them, and then me,’ but it was more like I always had a feeling that crept under my skin, eventually crawling out until I eventually had to face the music. </p>
			<p> Like every other unpleasant feeling, it became unbearable. I had to ask myself if whatever we had was still worth fighting for. For a while, I answered yes: 3 years of memories and a bond this strong couldn’t be thrown away like that. But also, I didn’t want to be alone, because I always knew that if I stopped fighting for it—for us, for them—I’d be the one left alone. There would no longer be an ‘us,’ there wouldn’t even be a ‘them, and then me,’ there’d only be a ‘them,’ and no room for ‘me’. </p>
			<p> Eventually, I chose to break it off. I can’t truly say I didn’t regret doing so; sometimes I lay awake at night staring at the ceiling just wondering what could’ve been if I just tried more or fought for us a little harder. I treasure a lot of the memories we made; from going to the mall together to sleeping together while holding each other’s hands like no one would tear us apart. They taught me how to love my friends, and I still carry that lesson with me today. </p>
			<p> But while I don’t regret the happiness we shared, I always felt like I was shackled and dragged by them. I’ve always felt our socio-economic class difference, thinking of myself as something lower than them because of it and thinking I had to live up to their life— to their level. I ended up spending more than what I used to, and doing things that I shouldn’t have. While that was a problem, more than that I was more burdened by the emotional toll it took on me—when I truly felt like an outsider. They would look at each other and their eyes would sparkle and shine with love. It was almost magnetic, what I saw in them. They were soulmates—the perfect protagonists in romantic dramas—and I was a mere side character that only really appears to comfort them and does nothing else. </p>
			<p> For the longest time, I thought my feelings were normal—the need to fit in and the feeling of wanting to change for your friends—but you don’t realize the whole world doesn’t burn when your house is on fire. So, when I finally broke off from these shackles, I felt lost. They were all that I knew—I didn’t know where or who to go to. I felt naked, but also lost. </p>
			<p> But while I was lost, I still had myself, so I focused on what I had. I found new and abandoned hobbies like writing, reading, and involving myself in music. I was playing the guitar again, getting back into my favorite K-POP artists, dancing my favorite choreographies, and I was discovering new artists every day. I found out that I liked chemistry; specifically physical, inorganic, and industrial chemistry, and that I wanted to pursue it in the near, near future. </p>
			<p> I always thought that being alone was this horrible experience; they say no man is an island, after all. But now I realize that it isn’t all that bad. Being alone taught me independence and allowed me to see from objective perspectives. It taught me how to be skeptical to protect my peace. I only had myself, but because of that, I got to know myself. I was alone, but I wasn’t lonely. No man is an island, but some are peninsulas. </p>
			<p> I discovered skills and found myself in positions that I didn’t think I’d be in. Now, I’m the director of our musical production and even joined an organization. I’m active in the creative writing club I’ve joined and found a way to express my feelings in healthier ways. I’ve signed up for a science immersion program for chemistry and felt that my mental health has taken a turn for the better. I found friendships in my roommates and classmates, and thankfully, I find myself enjoying life with them. While there’s still this fear of exclusion, of being eventually thrown away like what they did to me, I’m no longer afraid of being alone. I learned to enjoy my own company, and for that I am truly grateful. </p>
			<p> Taking charge of my own life is hard—just having to be accountable for or even just making my own decisions is a choice I have to make every day. But because of doing so, I found warmth in myself and others: no longer lost and bare. I found a new motivation to truly live my life; I wanted to be better for myself, and not for others. I learned that people don’t just stop having importance when some people aren’t in their lives. I hated the number three— it meant ‘them, and then me’. But then I realized: while there was a ‘them,’ but there was still a ‘me’. 3 = 2, + 1. </p>
