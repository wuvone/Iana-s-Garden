			<p> slow days are when i let myself stare. the kaleidoscope of your mind hidden behind those lovely, sharp eyes; the wonders of your brain cloaked by your soft, dark hair. </p>

			<p> a quiet curiosity blooms within me as the silence between us grows comfortable: what else about you can i fall in love with?  i watch you live your life as the air conditioning hums and rumbles, i watch you write and scribble away as the short hand swifts past the right side of the clock. we spend hours in our own little bubbles but i can’t help but admire yours from afar. <p>

			<p> perhaps i can fall in love with how quickly you write and sketch, like your hands could never catch up with your mind, always bursting with new ideas? or how you listen to the most unusual study music as i hear the electric tunes blast from your earphones? or how your face remains straight and unfazed while you go through pages and pages of paper, as if you can conquer any question or hurdle thrown in your direction? </p>

			<p style="font-style: italic; color: #5760cc"> darling, your reflection leaves a lovely mark on my pupils. </p>

			<p> hours have died and i’ve let myself stare. you’ve let yourself be showered with my kisses once the room has only us, and the doors and walls protect us condemning eyes. i listen to your heartbeat while you wrap me in your arms, your chest vibrating with warmth as you talk about feet-tall majestic machines — somethings i never-minded before you happened. each simple moment with you is a chance to love you for the first time all over again.</p>

			<p> <span style="font-style: italic; color: #5760cc"> i bathe in the gloriousness of having my head against your chest as it heaves up and down: you're alive and i’m here in your arms. i don’t want to breathe so fast that i’ll use up all my seconds with you, neither do i want to sleep that i’d waste to savor the breaths you take. </span> a paradox of mortality. despite my side steps in this never ending contradiction, our time was still up. <p>

			<p> we’re apart yet again. i’ll wait for the days i will sleep with you all to myself. would you be up for alone time for more than a few hours, my darling? i wish to spend eternity in your arms — eternity of sleepful nights with your breath tickling my ears. but for now i’ll wrap my arms around myself to soothe my longing ache for your touch.</p>
