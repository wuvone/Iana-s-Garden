			<p> I'm again in the body of my seven-year-old self, with ceaseless streams of saline cutting their courses on my cheeks while my hamstrung tongue loses its capacity for speech. The room around me is a complete mess. My eyes are blurry and I feel as heavy as the clouds, my heart as cold as the wind. I sniffle as I watch tiny droplets of rain trickle outside my window, tapping softly but incessantly on the window glass, just pleading to be let in. My grandmother’s wrinkled hands touch me so delicately, caressing my tear-stained cheeks, her sweet voice masking the foul bitterness of the nursery rhyme she whispers to me. It's dreadful–almost insulting–listening to her ask for the rain to go away, to come again another day, when all I want is anything but that. I find comfort in the rain’s company–the likeness in our tears, the rumbling of our chests, our shaky breaths. </p>
			<p> At a young age, my loved ones started whispering a particular question to my ear: <span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;"> Who are you? </span>I’ll later find that 17 years later, this query has captivated me–almost like a detective obsessed with an unsolved mystery. But time and time again, whenever the rain comes to visit this lost soul, I am reminded of whom I am. </p>
			<p> There is so much more to rain than just precipitation, so much more than mere drops of salt water falling from the heavens. Rain–<span style="font-weight: bold;"> She is so much more than just someone or something. </span> </p>
			<p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">She is a friend</span>. I tell Rain stories I don’t dare speak of in the presence of others. May it be fear of their judgement, isolation, or simply the discomfort of vulnerability in the eyes of those who perceive me. None of these has She done. None of these She’ll ever do. We would sit in Her pitter-patter and my sadness, our comfort, throughout the night. </p>
			<p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">She is family</span>. She visits, and suddenly everyone’s at the dinner table. Life pauses, and She gives us room to breathe, time to think, reason to come together. Like a sister, on days when I don’t feel like dressing myself for their eyes, She helps me excuse the layers and layers and layers of uncertainty. Or the moments when I know I can’t be, She whispers how sometimes it’s okay to be nothing and do nothing and feel nothing. </p>
			<p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">She is comfort and peace</span>. She is divine, soothing, calming, and peaceful, ever so capable of rocking the world to sleep. She patters like a steady drum beating in tandem with the perennial ticking of seconds, days, and years. She is her own clock, limitation, and obstacle. She lives by no laws but by Hers alone, coming and going at Her choosing. </p>
			<p> And if I were to worship other than God, it would be Rain. My praise, She deserves for Her gentleness despite Her power, Her acts of humanity despite Her divinity. She kisses the soil when She is needed the most, Her gentle reminder: I’m here for you, I’m listening. She is not all-mighty or all-powerful, but She is there, and She will listen and care—a sanctuary for the abandoned and unheard. </p>
			<p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">She is a lover</span>. Her gentle touch and soothing caress embracing the Earth, her tender kisses as she falls on your skin. She washes away the dust and worries, never failing to rejuvenate the world’s spirit. She nourishes the earth, akin to a lover nurturing Her partner’s soul. She connects us to nature, like a lover connecting us to our deepest desires and emotions with Her power to inspire and deepen our connection with the world around us.</p>
			<p> Perhaps She is all of this, and also maybe what I need the most; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Perhaps She is me</span>. Like Eliana–meaning God has answered–She is God’s answer to prayers, like I was to my parent’s pleas for a baby. Despite Rain’s ability to freely choose to be cruel, to force men to their knees in desperation at Her absence, She is sent by God, families rejoicing in the celebration of Her arrival. </p>
			<p> Small, yet powerful, undeniably impacting those around Her, no matter how brief Her presence is. Commanding attention, relentless in Her quest to be seen, heard, and felt. Rain is a struggle and a triumph. She is meaningful. <span style="font-weight: bold;">I am meaningful. I am Rain.</span> </p>
			<p> And when Rain comes, I never open an umbrella. If I could, I would lay on cold concrete and enjoy every wet drop landing on my skin. I would lay there even if it meant I could drown in Her. </p>
			<p> I'm again in the body of my seven-year-old self, with ceaseless streams of saline cutting their courses on my cheeks, wind blowing and pressing cold kisses against my face. I sniffle as I watch tiny droplets of rain trickle outside my window, tapping softly but incessantly on the window glass, just pleading to be let in. Years after, and at heart, I’m still the same girl who held her grandmother’s finger and begged Rain not to go away. </p>
