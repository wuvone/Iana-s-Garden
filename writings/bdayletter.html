			<p> puppy, </p>

			<p> happiest birthday my sweetest gumgum!!! <br>
			this morning, i’m writing with much love for the month of december, the humming warmth against my skin, toasted marshmallows where the muscle between each rib is supposed to be. i have to ask you myself: how has today been so far? have the cold winds been treating you well? i’ve been enjoying a little bit of winter musing lately. </p>

			<p> ive found that ive grown fond of the suffix -est with you. loveliest person, prettiest eyes, cutest baby, happiest ive ever been, safest with you, sweetest gumgumdi, dearest darling… but i think ill always prefer our very own -estesterestest. the things only we know and understand, because thats all i ever need anyway—to know you, to understand you. </p>

			<p> i love that you ask for the little things: a simple message that im okay, and what im doing every few hours to soothe your worries of losing something you chose, i know. i love how you love through the edges of your fingertips; running your fingers through my hair, playing with the thick strands, scratching my scalp and make me feel lovely as i am in your eyes. </p>

			<p> i find it endlessly dreadful that i yearn to be bored together, not alone. i like to think i love with every little cell in my body as they scream want want want. i say your name like a prayer no matter if i kneel to no god. and to know that ive chosen to love and love, to completely submit to someone and to find out that they always saw it the way i did from the very start…nothing more than ash and dust will be what remains of me when my lungs fill with breaths and breaths of our red double petal hibiscus. </p>

			<p> i have always found my desires to be nothing but revolting and disgusting. yet, this time it is for you, and anything for you is nothing but pure, bubba. so today, i choose you (insert pokemon reference). i choose to be here, and i am yours more than ever, my body, my soul, my words, my thoughts, and all. </p>

			<p> even my wishes and my secrets. </p>

			<p> so here they are, my love; today, i wish you this: i wish you love so sincere and genuine that it will never make you feel like you’re being eaten bit by bit, a love that fills you whole. i wish for you to thrive in a love and in awe of someone that you’ll never feel unappreciated, disrespected. i wish you love that is your pahinga, when the days are rough and the sky hangs low, you’ll want nothing but that love, resting on their lap, feeling their hands playing with your hair, and wishing to stay like that for all eternity. </p>

			<p> i wish you love that remains tender-hearted, through the dusk and dawns of life it will remain a consistent force that keeps you grounded. gentle kisses, fleeting touches, stealing looks, and deep conversations. i wish you love of one who writes poetry for you, musing lovely words that only you get to hear, telling the stars about you, and promising things that they never thought they’d promise again. i wish you love that’ll make you start asking yourself, “is this real? is this finally the love i have deserved all my life?” begging the universe for them to be the one, finally having the right person to love you as long as eternity lasts. </p>

			<p> i wish your hand feels three hard squeezes the moment you meet the love of all your lives after they walk down the aisle in white—“i love you.” i wish for a warm, home-cooked syruped pancake plate on your table when you wake up past sundown on days when you don’t feel like a person; to be tucked in your bed during the cold winter nights when you forget to put on comfortable pajamas and a fleece blanket. i wish for your hands to be locked and interlaced with theirs, rocking chairs creaking under your brittle bones and saggy skin’s weight while your garden, adorned with purple, red, and blue dots, dances in the wind. </p>

			<p> i wish to give you love like this, this love to feel like my own. </p>

			<p> do you know how long weve known each other, bubbi? its been around 1 year and 4 months and 7 days, 16 months and 7 days, 70 weeks and 4 days, 494 days and 11 856 hours and 711 360 minutes and 42 681 600 seconds and 42 681 600 000 milliseconds since i met you. </p>

			<p> and ever since, i have always wanted you, and i always will. i have learned to walk around these emotions, steady not to break the barrier that stops it from overflowing and falling apart, taking me with it and ruining me once more. </p>

			<p> with you, i refuse to let this, us,  be an ancient ruin to excavate. i want this love to be never ending; a challenge against mortality, the type of love that academics would fawn over as i write on love like you. and even if in the end, everything is finite, this one isnt. we arent. </p>

			<p> i hope i never grieve us. </p>

			<p> things i would have changed if i could:
			<ul>
				<li> it may have not been purposeful but i would rid of the hidden words that scarred you. i’d give you honesty, transparency, and safety. </li> <br>
				<li> i would give everything up just to go back in time and tell you everything i feel the moment i felt it, tell you every little detail about myself so you never feel like we don’t know each other. “listen to me for hours until forever feels a little too short, i’ll tell you things i’ve never told anyone and you’ll keep it; cherish it”. it’s unnerving to have someone completely know me, but i would let you, if i could try again. try again. </li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p> things i will do:
			<ul>
				<li> there’s nothing more complex than the idea of understanding. in a world where curiosity bleeds through our veins, we never take the time to sit down and understand the little things. of course, we have chemistry and a ton of other sciences but there’s never a proper way to understand the unpalatable, vast concept of love. i would read you like a book—thoroughly absorb the essence of each page and swallow each word whole. i will know you. i will come to understand the way you. </li> <br>
				<li> all stories end no matter how many times i wish to reread them; so i’ll kiss you more. it sounds shallow to some, but to me, it feels like i remember what it feels to live. a single kiss would inhale life into the hollow bones that reside between the thin, dying muscle inside my deathly pale skin. </li> <br>
				<li> someone could do something that would mean the entire world to them, and whoever is at the end of receiving it may not take a second glance that way. so, i’ll take my time to learn how you commit. i’ll talk to you in gibberish if it meant that i’d come close to saying my EB Garamond “i love you”’s in your Courier New. i’d love you all over again, in the way you  feel loved most. </li> <br>
				<li> lastly, but definitely not the least, i will admit to God Himself that you are my soul.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p> through these feelings and more, <br>
			yours, forever </p>
