			<p> <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> I love you, pangga. </span>
				<br> I love my mother. My mother is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
			</p>
			<p> She has sacrificed her wrist to be the canvas of my name, her body to bring me into this world, and her hair to watch over me as I grow old. Her life to take care of me. I fully know; I fully see.
			</p>
			<p> I resent her for this, putting me before her. I resent her for continuing; to forgive, watch, and sacrifice. I resent her for loving me— her unworthy shell of a daughter. <br>
				I resent myself for belittling her; her love, her words. I resent myself for not listening to her; her touch, her tears. I resent myself— my wretched self— for being loved.
			</p>
			<p> I dream about forgiveness. </p>
			<p> I dream about her singing; whispering lullabies; <br>
				<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> Stop crying, baby,</span> she says, <br>
				as I sniffle against her, slowly but surely dampening her shirt. <br>
				I can only fantasize about embracing her tightly, afraid she'll be whisked away from the wind— never to be seen again. I can only cry about her warmth while she's across from me, helpless.
			</p>
			<p> And yet I continue sleeping, unwilling to open my eyes. </p>
			<p> So I dream about repentance. <br>
			<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> I'm sorry, 'ma. </span> <br>
				I dream about tearful conversations; goodbyes. Dreams about regrets and soulless eyes staring right back at mine haunt me. They say to me, during those cold, sleepless nights, <br>
				<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> Do you see what you have done to me, 'ga? </span> <br>
				and I do not know what to say. I am hollow; an empty shell.
			</p>
			<p> It is too cruel to call them dreams, when they're anything but. They are nightmares. They reign over me. I lie awake at night wondering when the bed bugs will finally bite. <br>
				They never do. This is punishment, I think.
			</p>
			<p> I am on my knees, begging for a rest; for a day of solace in her arms. <br>
				<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> Please, another. After this, I can face the world. </span> I beg. <br>
				I plead; <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> Take the world off my shoulders, 'ma. </span> <br>
				She doesn't give it to me— she can't. Her shoulders far too baggy and worn for mine. She drifted far, far away, where no one could reach her, and so could I.
			</p>
			<p> I mourn for the living. <br>
				I dread the day I grieve for the dead.
			</p>
			<p> <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> I love you too, mama. </span> <br>
				I love my mother, but I wish she didn't love me. I am the worst thing that has ever happened to her.
