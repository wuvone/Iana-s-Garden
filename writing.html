				<p>I'm again in the body of my seven-year-old self, with ceaseless streams of saline cutting their courses on my cheeks while my hamstrung tongue loses its capacity for speech. The room around me is a complete mess. My eyes are blurry and I feel as heavy as the clouds, my heart as cold as the wind. I sniffle as I watch tiny droplets of rain trickle outside my window, tapping softly but incessantly on the window glass, just pleading to be let in. My grandmother’s wrinkled hands touch me so delicately, caressing my tear-stained cheeks, her sweet voice masking the foul bitterness of the nursery rhyme she whispers to me. It's dreadful–almost insulting–listening to her ask for the rain to go away, to come again another day, when all I want is anything but that. I find comfort in the rain’s company–the likeness in our tears, the rumbling of our chests, our shaky breaths.<br> <br>At a young age, my loved ones started whispering a particular question to my ear: Who are you? I’ll later find that 17 years later, this query has captivated me–almost like a detective obsessed with an unsolved mystery. But time and time again, whenever the rain comes to visit this lost soul, I am reminded of whom I am.</p>

				<p>As a child, I read books–fantasy books and fairy tales; and these books were my portal to fantasy. I would spend hours a day with my face buried in a book, and if it wasn’t there, it was clouded with daydreams of worlds I'd made up in my head. These stories made me realize that with just the right amount of fantasy, you could imagine, create, and understand almost anything. This is what fantasy and fiction do.<br> <br>Fantasy is the key to being imaginative. It transports us to another world, to another place where possibilities stretch farther than infinity. Fiction teaches us how to dream–how to dream for a better world, a better life. It is only through fantasy and imagination that we can invent, innovate, and create change.<br> <br>If we look back, we realize that fantasy has always been deeply ingrained in the human experience. Whenever our earliest civilizations wanted to teach, understand, to explore... </p>

				<p>I hate the number three. Whenever something comes in threes, they really mean they come in two, plus one. This rule applies to almost anything—car rides would always have two in the front and one in the back, roller coaster seats would always come in pairs, and even walking on the sidewalk means two people walking together while one is left following behind them. 3 = 2, + 1. But somehow, I believed we would work—an exception to the universal rule.<br> <br>We were the best of friends; we knew each other for about 3 years and had a friendship for the same time. We slept over at each other’s houses, and our parents had a group chat because of the amount of plans we made. We knew each other like the back of our hands: from our favorite colors to our deepest regrets and we talked to each other about everything. Or at least I thought so, because I feel like they’ve known me more than I’ve known them—like I’ve laid myself bare and cold for them, but they’re fully clothed in winter clothing. With them, I felt naked and blind.</p>

				<p>I love you, anak.<br> <br>I love my mother. My mother is the best thing that has ever happened to me.<br> <br>She has sacrificed her wrist to be the canvas of my name, her body to bring me into this world, and her hair to watch over me as I grow old. Her life to take care of me. I fully know; I fully see.<br> <br>I resent her for this, putting me before her. I resent her for continuing; to forgive, watch, and sacrifice. I resent her for loving me— her unworthy shell of a daughter.<br> <br>I resent myself for belittling her; her love, her words. I resent myself for not listening to her; her touch, her tears. I resent myself— my wretched self— for being loved...</p>

				<p>slow days are when i let myself stare. the kaleidoscope of your mind hidden behind those lovely, sharp eyes; the wonders of your brain cloaked by your soft, dark hair.<br> <br>a quiet curiosity blooms within me as the silence between us grows comfortable: what else about you can i fall in love with?  i watch you live your life as the air conditioning hums and rumbles, i watch you write and scribble away as the short hand swifts past the right side of the clock. we spend hours in our own little bubbles but i can’t help but admire yours from afar.<br> <br>perhaps i can fall in love with how quickly you write and sketch, like your hands could never catch up with your mind, always bursting with new ideas? or how you listen to the most unusual study music as i hear the electric tunes blast from your earphones? or how your face remains straight and unfazed while you go through pages and pages of paper, as if you can conquer any question or hurdle thrown in your direction?</p>
